## Credits

This was written from scratch but the API calls were learned in Week 6 content and the JQuery event listeners were learned in Week 5. We used these for help. We used a combination of JQuery and Vanilla JavaScript because we had multiple contributers and have yet to consolidate but this is on our roadmap. For styling we used MDBootstrap and other resources like Google and YouTube to learn.

## Features
